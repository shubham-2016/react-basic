    - create-react-app --version
    - create-react-app <project-directory>

* Requirement
    - Development Server => For Deployement.
    - Webpack => Bundling Files.
    - Babel => For Compiling Our JavaScript Code.

* Some Useful Commands

    npm start :- Starts the development server.
    
    npm run build :- Bundles the app into static files for protection.

    npm test :- start test runner.

    npm run eject :- Removes this tool and copies build dependencies,configuration files and scripts.

    we suggest you begin by typing:

* What is React Component ?

    - Components are the building blocks of any React app.
    - Components are like functions that return HTML elements.
    - Components are independent and reusable bits of code. 
    - They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and returns HTML via a render function.
    - Components come in two types, Class components and Function components, in this tutorial we will concentrate on Class components.

* How to create component ?

    -- Create a Class Component
        
        - When creating a React component, the component's name must start with an upper case letter.
        - The component has to include the extends React.Component statement, this statement creates an inheritance to React.Component.
        - The component also requires a render() method, this method returns HTML.
        
        - Example

        #  index.js
            
            import React from 'react';
            import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

            class Car extends React.Component {
                render() {
                    return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
                }
            }

            ReactDOM.render(<Car />, document.getElementById('root'));

        # index.html

        <div id="root"></div>

    -- Create a Function Component
        
        - Example

        #  index.js
            
        import React from 'react';
        import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

        function Car() {
            return <h2>Hi, I am also a Car!</h2>;
        }

        ReactDOM.render(<Car />, document.getElementById('root'));

* What is jsx ?
    - JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
    - JSX allows us to write HTML in React.
    - JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.
    - Example. 

* Difference Props vs State ?

* What is state ?

* What is stateless functional component ?

* What is Life Cycle Hooks?
    - Mount --> constructor, render, componentDidMount
    - Update --> render, componentDidUpdate
    - Unmount -->  componentWillMount
